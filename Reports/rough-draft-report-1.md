## Title and Introduction

America’s punitive and individualistic attitudes in pursuit of competitive advantage and exceptionalism comes at great cost. Although policy and political decisions must be made with regards to the context of the society they pertain to and thus not every conceivable option is available because of limiting historical and cultural perspectives, one can make an effort to compare overall wellness and happiness between this great country and other affluent nations. This year Finland ranked number one as the happiest country and the U.S. dropped to its lowest historical position, 25th. [ https://apnews.com/article/world-happiness-report-ranking-finland-afghanistan-us-b41c1712448762d98fe9e4f80233c15f ]. The two countries differ significantly in providing for those on the margins. “[A]ccording to the Constitution of Finland, anyone who is unable to acquire the necessary security for a dignified life is entitled to essential subsistence and care.” [ https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/finland-homeless-housing-first-approach?utm_source=chatgpt.com in the U.S, we have come to accept that society delivers its bounty disproportionately to a select few. The acceptance of this practice can be traced historically but the results of this perspective can be seen in the comparative percentage of homeless between Finland and the U.S. In 2024, Finland estimated 0.06% of its population was homeless. In contrast the U.S. estimated .2% of the population experienced homelessness. [ https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/finland-homeless-housing-first-approach?utm_source=chatgpt.com ] Finland’s ability to care and nurture their population through both their government and through their shared cultural connections creates an environment of trust and ease which account for their increased happiness in comparison to the U.S.
