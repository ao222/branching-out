## Title and Introduction

The OEDC, an economic consortium of developed nations, estimates its member nations have on average 25 people per 10,000 unhoused [source](https://www.oecd.org/en/topics/sub-issues/affordable-housing/homelessness.html). Here in the United States, data from 2024 estimates about 23 people per 10,000 are unhoused [source](https://www.developmentaid.org/news-stream/post/157797/homelessness-statistics-in-the-world). Although it seems other wealthy nations also struggle with housing their most vulnerable populations, one must ask if there is a better way. 

One Finish non-profit said, “The ethical perspective means that homelessness has to be eliminated because human dignity belongs to everyone. A home is a human right,” [source](https://www.goodgoodgood.co/articles/finland-homeless-housing-first-approach). According to research [source](https://nlihc.org/resource/systematic-research-review-finds-benefits-housing-first-programs-us-outweigh-costs) the cost per person per year for homelessness is $18,247 while the cost of Housing First initiatives is $16,479. Therefore, society has both a moral and economic impetus to scale these initiatives efficiently. Understanding the nature and causes of the homeless population is vital in this effort. 

We will be building a model to predict the size of the homeless population in local areas based on economic and demographic data. We will also identify the importance of each predictor to better understand what impacts the overall size of the homeless population. Identifying these variables could inform policy makers on strategy and policy development to help decrease homelessness. While predicting the number of people suffering homelessness in a local area could help with logistics and planning.
