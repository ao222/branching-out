* Redo automl.ipynb
 *  reduce needed code
 *  find a source to learn the reduced code
 *  Find out how many observations they use in their models compare to my ~3900
   
*  Revise Data (the data I have downloaded)
 *  list the downloads and description of each
 *  download ACS datasets
    
*  Research methods and build out methods section
 *  feature importance
 *  models to use
    
*  Think of possible data to add
 *  local weather data by CoC (temp and precip)
 *  look through ACS datasets (are their any other features I could use?)
