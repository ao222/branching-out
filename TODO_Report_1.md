* Redo automl.ipynb
  *  reduce needed code
  *  find a source to learn the reduced code
  *  Find out how many observations they use in their models compare to my ~3900
   
*  Revise Data (the data I have downloaded)
  *  List the downloads and description of each
  *  Download ACS datasets
    
*  Research methods and build out methods section
  *  Feature importance
  *  models to use
    
*  Think of possible data to add
  *  local weather data by CoC (temp and precip)
  *  look through ACS datasets (are their any other features I could use?)
