# Project Proposal

A found a data set and accompanying regression and ML models on github that aims to predict the homeless population for a local area based on local economic and demographic factors. I'm interested in extending this for my term project. If this data set seems exciting and you'd like to work with me, please DM me. Here are links for the interested:

* [Project Extension Ideas](TODO: add link to this document)

# Previous Project's Current Form 
## From A Boston University Research Project

## Project Overview:
Goal: Develop a predictive model of homelessness at the community level using data from 2007-2023.
Focuses on approximately 400 Continuums of Care (CoC) that receive federal homeless assistance funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
Unique Focus: Unlike previous studies that predict homelessness at the individual level, this project centers on community-level factors.

## Data Sources:
Primary Data: Annual homelessness counts from HUD across CoC units.
Additional Data: Publicly available community-level factors such as rent rates, demographic and economic conditions, aggregated by CoC.
Timeframe: 2007 to 2023.

## Key Research Questions:
Moving beyond simply identifying associations between community-level factors and homelessness.
Objective: Predict the number or rate of homelessness in each CoC based on structural determinants like rent levels and economic conditions.

## Methodology and Tools:
Modeling Approach: Regression models or other predictive machine learning techniques.
Required Skills: Familiarity with regression models, feature engineering, and experience with the pandas and scikit-learn packages in Python.

# How We'd Extend the Project

## Data
* Updating it to currently available governmental data
* Adding additional data sources-ideas include:
    * local exprenditures on mental-health /substance abuse programs
    * uninsured rates
    * local weather data
    * other ideas welcome

## Models
* Selecting algorithmic models not already completed in the original project (one for each group member)
* Comparing the performance of our models to the four models already completed in the original project
* Models already completed:
    * Linear regression
    * Random forest
    * Histogram Gradient boosting
    * Extreme Gradient Boosting

## Extra Thoughts

* I'm going to reach out to connections I have at the [Beacon](https://www.beaconhomeless.org/) to potentially get perspectives from someone versed in providing services to the local Houston homeless population. Would welcome anyone from the group to attend this meeting but it wouldn't be necessary.
* It could be interesting to investigate applications of these models, i.e. are the completed models useful in projecting demand at local Houston shelters. If not, what would be needed to make them useful?
* **I'm open to any and all ideas for extending this project**
